# Image Tampering Detection App

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload an image and detects tampering or manipulative content. The backend is powered by Flask, while the frontend is built with Vite and React.

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload an image via the frontend.
- **Tampering Detection:** The backend analyzes the uploaded image for tampering and manipulative content.
- **Detection Mask:** If tampering is detected, a mask showing the tampered areas is generated and returned.
- **Fast Frontend:** The frontend is built with React and Vite for a fast development and build process.

## Backend Setup (Flask)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/03-lovepreetSingh/image-Detection
    cd image-Detection/backend
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Flask server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

The server will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python app.py
    ```

2. Start the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

Access the app by opening your browser and going to `http://localhost:5173`. You can upload an image, and the app will communicate with the Flask backend to analyze the image.

## API Endpoint

- **POST** `/analyze`:  
  Expects a file upload (an image).
  
  Example request using curl:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -F "image=@path_to_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/analyze
    ```

  **Response:** JSON object with tampering analysis results:

    ```json
    {
      "analysis": "Deceptive content found",
      "tampered": true,
      "mask_path": "static/mask.png"
    }
    ```

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed image analysis and improve tampering detection algorithms.
- Support for multiple image formats and larger image sizes.
- Frontend improvements, including better error handling and user feedback.
