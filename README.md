# Image Tampering Detection App

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload an image and detects tampering or manipulative content. The backend is powered by Flask, while the frontend is built with Vite and React.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image via the frontend.
- **Tampering Detection**: The backend analyzes the uploaded image for tampering and manipulative content.
- **Detection Mask**: If tampering is detected, a mask showing the tampered areas is generated and returned.
- **Fast Frontend**: The frontend is built with React and Vite for a fast development and build process.

```

## Backend Setup (Flask)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-tampering-detection.git
   cd image-tampering-detection/backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the app**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`. You can upload an image, and the app will communicate with the Flask backend to analyze the image.

## API Endpoint

- **POST `/analyze`**: 
  - Expects a file upload (an image).
  - Example request using `curl`:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -F "image=@path_to_image.jpg" http://localhost:5000/analyze
    ```
  - **Response**: JSON object with tampering analysis results:
    ```json
    {
      "analysis": "Deceptive content found",
      "tampered": true,
      "mask_path": "static/mask.png"
    }
    ```

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed image analysis and improve tampering detection algorithms.
- Support for multiple image formats and larger image sizes.
- Frontend improvements, including better error handling and user feedback.
